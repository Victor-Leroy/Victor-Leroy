## Hi there 👋

Hi I'm Victor LEROY :D!

Here are some cool projects I worked on:

### [**Intermarché Bubble:**](https://github.com/algosup/2024-2025-project-5-bubble-intermarche-team-6)

The goal of this project was to create a lightweight prototype web/mobile app designed to help Intermarché customers easily find recommended products in-store based on simple user input.

### **Pumpkin:**

This is a project that was done during an Hackathon in Bourges. The idea of the project was to create free access shops in campaigns to allow farmers to sell their products without needing them to always be there. We finished 2nd place during that event.

### [**Sportshield:**](https://github.com/algosup/2023-2024-project-4-sportshield-team-8)

SportShield is an innovative anti-theft device designed for sports equipment, equipped with sensors and actuators to detect movement, activate an alarm, and notify the owner.
It has been designed by Coris Innovation. As a subcontractor, our team has been charged with the improvement of the device's software. During this project, I was in charge of doing the user manual to explain all the details regarding the usage of the device.
